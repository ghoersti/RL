# RL

# dim_red


Repository of notebooks used to complete assignment 4.  The code covers analysis that was desired for assignment 4 but its not very cohesive, but all code required for a particular model is found within the notebook with the models name. 

## Usage
Assuming python 3.9 and conda are installed create the env using.
`conda env create -f RL37.yml`


Open jupyter
`jupyter notebook` execute code as needed


# data
Contained in root directory.

# Note
The parent directory path inside the notebooks will need to be changed to reflect absolute path to the `data` directory


# Code used to aid in discovery
